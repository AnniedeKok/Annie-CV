                <h1>Welcome, a little bit about me</h1>
                <p>Nothing in life was ever handed to me, and this made me a fighter. Continuous self-improvement and hard work are all that guarantees success. Ever since I was young, I saw injustices in the world that I felt powerless to. As I grew older, I devoted myself to correct these injustices. I have a passion for law, learning and people. My main drive is to succeed, every failure is ammunition to win my next battle.</p>
                <p>The biggest lesson I have learnt is that whenever I thought I couldnâ€™t do something, that there is someone else who is confidently doing it wrong right now. They have no plan or intention of doing it better and people are paying them as is. I have learnt to believe in my own excellence and my ability to always improve as much as they believe in their mediocrity. </p>
